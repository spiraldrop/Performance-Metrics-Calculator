# Performance-Metrics-Calculator

## Overview
The project focuses on computing performance metrics for given datasets without using the sklearn library. The project involves tasks such as computing confusion matrices, F1 scores, AUC scores, accuracy scores, and identifying the best threshold to minimize a specific metric. Additionally, there are performance metrics for regression tasks, including mean squared error, MAPE, and R^2 error.
